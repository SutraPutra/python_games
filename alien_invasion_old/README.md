This is a game created by following the book Python Crash Course. No starch press.

I have expanded the game in the following ways:
1. Added the background music which plays on a loop
2. Added the Start up (ready go) sound
3. Added the bullet firing sound
4. Added the alien ship explosion sound
5. Added a level up sound
6. Set fps for the game.
7. Add 5 different types of aliens in the fleet

To add the following features:
1. Add explosion sprites - animate it
2. Make the aliens shoot bullets
3. Have a health bar below player ship. Ship takes 5 hits to explode.
4. Save the highscore in a json file.
5. Have a escape button to pause the game
